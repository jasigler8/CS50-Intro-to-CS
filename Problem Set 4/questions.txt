0.  JPG - ~16,000,000, GIF - 256, PNG - ~16,000,000, BMP - ~16,000,000
1.  GIF supports animation
2.  Lossy Compression doesn't encode all the information from the file, so when it's recovered, it's not an exact representation, but allows for 
    greater compression and thus smaller file sizes. Better for photographs. Lossless maintains all information about a file.
3.  JPEG use lossy compression
4.  Two things:
    1. The system modifies the filename's first character to signal that it has
       been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
       (Most OSs simply remove the file's reference from the containing dir.)
    2. The system moves all of the file's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list
       of free clusters.
    The file's data is never touched.
5.  Write NUL bytes (or random characters) to every address on the disk.
    There's consensus that "overwriting a disk with a few random passes" is sufficient
6.  It's the library contains simple data types that are defined by either a C/C++ typedef or #define statement.
7.  You can choose exactly how big to make your types
8.  BYTE -  8 bits/1 byte
    DWORD  - 32 bits/4 bytes
    LONG - 32 bits/4 bytes
    WORD - 16 bits/2 bytes
9.  it must be in the type BITMAPHEADERFILE for bftype
    hexadecimal: 0x424d
    ASCII: BM
10. bfSize is the number of bytes for the file, biSize is the number of bytes for the header (BM is 40)
11. if biheight is negative, then the file should be read topdown and cannot be compressed
12. biBitCount
13. If it can't find the file or open it
14. Because we are always reading 1 struc at a time
15. (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4
    (4 - ((3*3%4)%4)) = 4-2 = 2
16. fseek changes the offset of the file pointer, i.e. if you want to skip padding
17. SeekCurr is the current position of the pointer
